## Hi there 👋 I'm David. 

**Eclectic Software Engineer, Bootcamp grad from [BrainStation](https://brainstation.io/) and Self-taught programmer and musician.**


💼 &nbsp;I’m currently looking for full-time employment opportunities and at the same time taking freelance jobs, and building my own websites.

🪖 &nbsp;With avid experience in the Military and Private Security world, I've decided to take the leap and charge into my Tech career.

🌱 &nbsp;I’m currently learning TypeScript and reinforcing my knowledge of already learned technologies.

⚡ &nbsp;Fun fact: I have a vintage 1992 Orville Les Paul 🎸 that I bought on a whim in London. Very cool instrument :)

😄 &nbsp;When I'm not coding I like listening to and playing music, playing the latest and greatest gaming titles, and going to sports events.  

🙋‍♂️ &nbsp;he/him

**👀 &nbsp;Tech I'd like to try out**  
Vue, TypeScript, ChakraUI, Go, Electron, GraphQL, Three.js, Next.js, Tailwind, SolidJS, Redux Toolkit, Svelte
